# WSI-based deep learning classifier in papillary renal cell carcinoma
Deep learning for prediction of the clinical outcome in papillary renal cell carcinoma.

The model was built around multiple instance learning and comprised a MobileNet V3 representation network, a Noisy-AND pooling function, and a fully connected classification network similar to the one used by Skrede et al. A updated version based on our previous study in ccRCC.
